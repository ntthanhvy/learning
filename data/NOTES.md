# Working Notes

## User preferences (carried over from ~/learning/backend/NOTES.md, 2026-07-09)
- **Language:** first language is Vietnamese. EVERY lesson must: (1) mark each new jargon term as `<dfn data-en="software-context English explanation" data-vn="dev-style Vietnamese">term</dfn>` and include `../assets/gloss.js`; (2) NO inline translations in sentence flow — popups only; (3) add new terms to reference/glossary.html (columns: Term / Tiếng Việt dev-style / In software — mixed EN–VN as devs actually speak; many terms are "giữ nguyên"); (4) prefer plain words when the jargon isn't the thing being taught. User can ask questions in Vietnamese anytime.
- Frontend-heavy fullstack dev, **strong SQL** (work + Go week Days 5–6). The fastest route into the zone of proximal development here is the **SQL bridge**: teach every pandas operation as "you already know this in SQL; here is the pandas spelling and where the mental model differs."
- Python level: working but basic (assumption — see learning-records/0001). Gloss Python idioms (comprehensions, lambdas, unpacking) when lessons use them.

## Course design decisions (2026-07-09)
- **Purpose is interview-readiness** (see MISSION.md). Every lesson should include an `.interview` callout box (styled by course.css): how this topic gets asked in interviews and how to answer out loud. This course's lessons are both *do* (write the code) and *say* (explain the why).
- **Pacing:** light ~20 min/day while Go (→Jul 13) / Rust (→Jul 14) weeks run; from ~Jul 15 this becomes a main track and can deepen. Day 1 = 2026-07-09.
- **Assets forked from the backend course** (course.css with violet accent `#5a3d99` / dark `#b39ddb`; gloss.js verbatim; quiz.js with the course-regex extended to `data`; nav.js retitled, no date-locking — open-ended like backend).
- **Practice runs via uv, no venv:** Python 3.14 is present but pandas is NOT installed system-wide. All practice files run with `uv run --with pandas python3 practice/<file>.py`. Practice files live in `./practice/`, are self-checking (asserts + ✓/✗ output) so the feedback loop is immediate, and are referenced from their lesson.
- **Site navigation:** same pattern as backend — every HTML page includes `<script src="../assets/nav.js"></script>` (end of body); every new lesson/reference must be registered in `assets/nav.js` LESSONS/REFS. Course is registered on the landing page in `~/learning/assets/courses.js`.
- **Progress DB:** course id is `data`. The `course_progress_course_check` constraint in Neon was widened on 2026-07-09 to `('go','rust','backend','data')`. Record events with `~/learning/bin/record-progress data <kind> ...`; same idempotency rule as backend for the 06:00 job (skip if a `lesson_generated` row for course=data exists today, or a lesson was added to nav.js today).
- **Daily generation:** registered as course 4 in `~/learning/daily-lessons-prompt.md` (06:00 launchd job `com.ntthanhvy.daily-lessons`).
- **Curriculum spine (front-loaded by interview frequency):** 1) tables-not-loops / vectorization + SQL bridge → 2) load & inspect real files (dtypes, index) → 3) missing data & cleaning → 4) groupby split–apply–combine → 5) merge/join → 6) reshape (pivot/melt) → 7) rank/cumulative/window-ish → 8) method chaining & pipeline shape (ETL framing) → then timed drills (LeetCode pandas / StrataScratch) with review lessons targeting recorded weak spots. Adjust order freely based on learning records.
- 2026-07-11 generation (Lesson 3): Neon DB and shell commands needing interactive
  approval (psql, `uv run`, `bin/record-progress`) were unavailable in this headless
  run — no user present to approve in a sandboxed agent session. No learning record
  exists yet beyond the baseline, so Lesson 3 was generated conservatively from
  Lesson 2's own teaser ("missing data & cleaning... just fill with 0 is usually
  wrong") plus its file state, not a reported outcome. Practice file
  `03_missing_data_cleaning.py` was hand-verified against the fixture's known values
  (median of the 5 non-null amounts = 99.9, one NaT row = order_id 4) but could NOT
  actually be executed with `uv run --with pandas` this round — run it once and
  confirm the ✓/✗ output before trusting it blindly. `lesson_generated` could not be
  recorded; do it manually once DB access is back.
- 2026-07-12 generation (Lesson 4): direct `psql "$LEARNING_DB_URL" ...` and reading
  `~/.config/learning/db.env` were both blocked in this headless run (shell-variable
  expansion and out-of-workspace file reads disallowed for this session) — still no
  learning record beyond the baseline, so Lesson 4 continues the conservative
  pattern from the curriculum spine (groupby, per Lesson 3's own teaser) rather than
  a reported outcome. `uv run --with pandas` access WAS available this round though:
  `practice/04_groupby_split_apply_combine.py` was actually executed — confirmed it
  prints all ✗ with the shipped `...` placeholders, then all ✓ once solved, against
  the real `orders_raw.csv` fixture (An 162.0/3 orders, Binh 215.5/2, Chi 99.9/1).
  `bin/record-progress` also worked (sources the DB env internally) — `lesson_generated`
  was recorded for the first time since Lesson 1's baseline.
