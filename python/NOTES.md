# Python Intensive — working notes & conventions

Authoritative for lesson generation. `daily-lessons-prompt.md` defers to this file.

## Course conventions

Identical to `data/` unless stated:

- Every jargon term gets `<dfn data-en="…" data-vn="…">term</dfn>` and the page
  loads `../assets/gloss.js`. **No inline translations in prose.** Every new
  term also gets a row in `reference/glossary.html`.
- Quizzes use `../assets/quiz.js`. Options within one question must have the
  same word count — position and length must carry no signal.
- Every lesson ends with `<script src="../assets/nav.js"></script>` and is
  registered in `assets/nav.js` `LESSONS` (new reference sheets go in `REFS`).
- Every lesson: one tangible win, ~20 min, cites `RESOURCES.md`, recommends one
  primary source, and closes with a reminder to ask the teacher follow-ups —
  Vietnamese welcome.
- `assets/quiz.js` here differs from `data/`'s by one character: the
  `QUIZ_COURSE` regex includes `python`. If assets are ever re-copied from
  another course, re-add it or quiz results stop reaching the DB.

## The hard rule: no pandas

`MISSION.md` puts pandas and NumPy out of scope — they belong to `data/`, which
is running in parallel and is 21 lessons deep. **Never teach a pandas API in
this course.** A one-line contrast ("pandas spells this `groupby`") is allowed
and useful; a worked pandas example is not.

This matters operationally: on 2026-07-23..24 two generators produced
overlapping lessons on the same topics under different numbers and blocked
every `git pull` for a week. Topic overlap between courses is the same failure
in slower motion. When a topic could belong to either course, ask: *is the
subject the language, or the library?* Language → here. Library → `data/`.

## Learner profile

Can read and understand simple Python; **everything else is being built from
zero**. Do not use a construct before the lesson that teaches it — in
particular comprehensions (Day 2), `key=` functions and `lambda` (Day 4),
generators (Day 5), and type hints (Day 7). Before Day 2, code samples use
plain `for` loops on purpose.

Strong SQL, and pandas *concepts* are landing in parallel via `data/`. Use both
as bridges — "this is `GROUP BY`, done by hand" — but never re-teach either.

## Phase 1 is date-locked

`PLAN.md` pre-assigns Days 1–7 to exact filenames and dates
(2026-07-29 → 2026-08-04). Use them exactly; do not pre-generate ahead of the
date. From 2026-08-05 the course goes open-ended and sequential from
`0008-…`, following the Phase 2 spine in `PLAN.md` — adapt ordering to the
learning records rather than marching through it.

## Practice files

`practice/NN_<name>.py`, one per lesson, mirroring `data/`'s self-checking
style but **standard library only** — no third-party imports, so `uv run
python3 practice/NN_x.py` needs no `--with`. Each file is a series of small
TODOs with a `check()` that prints ✓/✗ per task and a final tally.

Before shipping a practice file, verify in a scratch dir that (a) the shipped
form runs and reports ✗ for the unsolved TODOs without crashing, and (b) a
solved copy prints all ✓. A traceback instead of a ✗ is a bug — the file must
fail *gracefully* so the learner sees which task failed.

## Generation log

- 2026-07-29 — Course created in a live session (not the headless run), on the
  user's request for a Python course majoring in data handling, pipelines, and
  wrangling, then backend. Scope was negotiated with the user: complement
  `data/` rather than overlap it (hence the no-pandas rule), FastAPI + pydantic
  for the backend phase, intensive week first then open-ended. Day 1 was
  written by hand in that session, so the headless run on 2026-07-29 was
  already past — Day 2 (2026-07-30) is the first lesson CI generates here.
- 2026-07-29 — **DB schema touched.** `course_progress` had a CHECK constraint
  allowing only `go|rust|backend|data`, so the first `record-progress python …`
  was rejected outright. Widened it to include `python`:
  `ALTER TABLE course_progress DROP CONSTRAINT course_progress_course_check;`
  then re-added with `python` in the array. There is **no migration file
  anywhere in the repo** — the schema lives only in the Neon DB, so this note
  is the only record of the change. Any future course needs the same widening,
  plus the `QUIZ_COURSE` regex in that course's `assets/quiz.js`, or its
  progress and quiz results vanish silently.
